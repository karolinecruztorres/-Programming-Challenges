# Dots Menu

## A expanding menu, built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This menu has a modern layout and introduced me to the "<span>" tag and the "filter" property.

## Original code from channel "Online Tutorials": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OLDpdqdyWE&list=PL5e68lK9hEzc8P9BJCSX1k9C8uKAV5Oa5&index=2
